<h1>Hello Hacker</h1>
<img src="public/image/McHack.jpg" alt="McHack" width="100" height="100">
<h2>The following is some basic structure we will use in this project.</h2>
<p>It contains the following (I will place one of example of each for our backend developer):</p>
<ul>
<li>Controller</li>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/chenhongye11/82fa04bc508ecc8db96aec101b12baf6.js"></script>
<li>Service</li>
<li>Mapper</li>

<p>ps: For our poor frontend developer, I have configure /public as our directory for frontend resource. Please place your hard work there!!</p>
<div>*Please read README.md carefully to setup the environment and start developing.</div>

</ul>
